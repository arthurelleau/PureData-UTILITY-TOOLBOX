PureData-Utility-Toolbox
A bunch of basic tools for PD Vanilla, Extented and PurrData/L2Ork.

The tools are abstractions (sub-patches savec in a precise file that allow PD to use them as objects), so you just have to create a path to the UTILITY folder (anywhere you download it in you computer) in PD startup preferences to use the tools !
